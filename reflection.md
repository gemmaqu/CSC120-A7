I think this one is relatively easy homework for me. The most hard part of this homework would be Library. I am confused about the difference between "containstitles" and "isAvailable". And I made a mistake at first writing the check out method and return method. I match a wrong else to if.

I feel very happy after finishing this homework! It makes me feel I learned a lot at this point- at the mid of the semester. I'll see if there's any methods I need to improve after insturctor give me feedback.

Also, I don't know why do we have a Course class, which is not used in this assignment by me.
