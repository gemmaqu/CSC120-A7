            I add "boolean hasDiningRoom" as a parameter

        throw a runntimeexception for book that already checked out in public void checkOut(String title) method
    Grading commemt:Constructor incorrect. Check README requirements
        I went to your office hour and you said my constructor is right :)
3. Cafe:
    Grading comment:Does not check stock before selling, so inventory can go negative
        fixed: checking the stock before selling the coffe in the  public void sellCoffee(int size, int nSugarPackets, int nCreams) method, and if there's not enough stock, throw an exception so that the cafe would restock
4. General:
    Grading comment:Missing/incomplete/misplaced/malformed @param / @return in Javadoc comments.& Review capitalization / naming conventions
        checked all the capitalization and java doc comments.


I think this one is relatively easy homework for me. The most hard part of this homework would be Library. I am confused about the difference between "containstitles" and "isAvailable". And I made a mistake at first writing the check out method and return method. I match a wrong else to if.

I feel very happy after finishing this homework! It makes me feel I learned a lot at this point- at the mid of the semester. I'll see if there's any methods I need to improve after insturctor give me feedback.

Also, I don't know why do we have a Course class, which is not used in this assignment by me.
